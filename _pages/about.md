Hi, I’m Hui Zhang, a Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer with a Ph.D. in Neuroscience and over 10 years of experience in data analysis, predictive modeling, and research. I specialize in building end-to-end ML solutions using Python, SQL, Docker, and MLOps tools like MLflow and Airflow. My work spans healthcare, traffic forecasting, and product analytics—always driven by a passion for turning complex data into actionable insights. I enjoy collaborating across disciplines and continuously learning new technologies.

Feel free to explore my projects and connect!
